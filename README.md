WRO 2024 SNOOPY
====

## 1. Introduction

Hello and welcome to the github repository of our team Snoopie. Our team has been working hard for this year's WRO competition, there has been many issues that we faced during these time. One of it being managing time from school to build and develop our robot. You can find more information of our project below in the content area.

*Furthermore*, we'd like to elaborate on what's WRO, especially Future Engineer category. WRO stands for ***World Robotic Olympiad***, According to their website [About WRO](https://wro-association.org/wro-foundation/):
> WRO Foundation is a 501c3 USA non-profit organization founded to support World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Association and its efforts to encourage as many young people as possible to take an interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering & mathematics (STEM) through educational robotic competitions and skills development activities in the United States and worldwide.

*Future Engineer* is one of the 4 category that WRO have, and it's main goal is to develop a self driving car that has the abilities to avoid obstacle and park on its own. This category focus on the use of computer vision, and sensor fusion to develop an open source vehicle. This category differ to other categories as our hardware and software choices are all free of choice, meaning we can pick whatever we want. However our robot has to follow a certain dimension and weight as required by the [FE Rules](https://wro-association.org/wp-content/uploads/WRO-2024-Future-Engineers-Self-Driving-Cars-General-Rules.pdf).
